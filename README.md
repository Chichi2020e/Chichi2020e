ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Chichi. Iâ€™m diving into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on real impact and fresh ideas. As a student of Informatics, Iâ€™m exploring how smart systems can help us make better decisions and create better experiences.

I work with Python, train models, build data pipelines, and design experiments that turn raw data into intelligent tools. From prompt engineering to model optimization, Iâ€™m always asking how we can push the boundaries of what AI can do.

My projects are where curiosity meets code. I see AI not just as a technology but as a new form of creativity and collaboration. This space is for learning, building, and sharing the journey as I grow in the field.

Welcome to my GitHub. Letâ€™s see what we can create!
